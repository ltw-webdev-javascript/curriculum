      ## JavaScript ≠ Java

      *Two completely different programming languages*
    notes: |
      When searching for answers **do not** search for Java—you’ll get confusing results because the Java programming language is *completely different* from JavaScript.

      Remember the “Peanut M&M” analogy? Well we’ve so far only talked about the peanut (HTML/content) & the chocolate (CSS/design), now we’re going to talk about the candy: JavaScript.

      JS isn’t necessary for a website (a chocolate covered peanut is still quite delicious) but depends completely on CSS & HTML to function.

      ## A new syntax

      - `variable` — a box that holds something

      - `if-statement` — branches our code 1 of 2 ways

      - `loop` — repeats our code a number of time

      - `switch` — multiple branches

      ## Variable contents

      - `string` — just some text, surrounded in ''
      - `number` — just a number, no quotes
      - `boolean` — `true` or `false`
      - `array` — a collection, like `<ol>`
      - `object` — a named collection, like `<dl>`
      - `function` — a piece of re-usable code
